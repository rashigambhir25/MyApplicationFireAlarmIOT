**IoT-Enabled Smart Fire Alert System**

**Overview**

This project presents an IoT-based Smart Fire Alert System designed for real-time fire detection and rapid emergency response. The system uses a Raspberry Pi along with cloud-based APIs to monitor temperature, smoke, and air quality levels, triggering alerts through LED indicators and notifying emergency services when hazardous conditions are detected.

**Features**

1. Real-time monitoring of fire hazards

2. Raspberry Pi for data processing and alert management

3. API integration for temperature and air quality data

4. LED indicator alerts

5. Emergency service notifications

**Technologies Used**

1. Hardware: Raspberry Pi 2, LED bulbs, Telldus

2. Software: Java, Raspberry Pi GPIO Library

3. APIs: OpenWeather API, Open Meteo API

**Usage**

1. The system continuously monitors environmental data.

2. When thresholds are exceeded, LED bulbs light up and alerts are sent to emergency services.
